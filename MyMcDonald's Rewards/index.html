        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">What Do I Have to Do to Earn Points?</h3>
            <p class="word-1b">Earning rewards points is very easy, simply <span><a href="n">download our app</a></span> and agree to participate in MyMcDonald’s Rewards. Present the 4-digit code before ordering, or get points automatically when you order in the app.</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">How Much Are Points Worth?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">For every dollar you spend on eligible products, you will receive 100 points. You can start redeeming your MyMcDonald’s Rewards when you have 1500 points.</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">Do My Points Expire?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Unfortunately, nothing can last forever. Your points will expire on the first day of the month after the sixth month from the day your points were earned. Plenty of time to save up for your favorite!</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">Can I Share My Points?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Your MyMcDonald's Rewards points are yours alone. Once you have your food, it’s up to you whether you want to share!</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">How Do I Redeem Points for Free McDonald’s?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">You can redeem with contactless mobile ordering in the McDonald's app by selecting Rewards, choosing the favorite you want to redeem and choosing “Add to Mobile Order”. To redeem in store or Drive Thru, select rewards and choose the item you want to redeem, then choose “Use at Restaurant” to get the 4-digit code you can provide the crew before you start ordering. For delivery orders placed using the McDonald’s app, select your reward item and add that to your McDelivery order. Rewards cannot be redeemed for delivery orders placed with a third party operator such as DoorDash and Uber Eats.</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">Can I Redeem a Reward And Earn Points in the Same Order?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Yes! You earn points on every eligible purchase, so if you’re redeeming a reward and ordering more food in addition to that, you will still earn 100 points for every dollar you spend.</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">What If I Forgot to Provide My Code?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">If you’re enjoying your order and suddenly realized you never provided your code, no worries! Take these steps to contact us in the app:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select More in the bottom navigation</li>
                    <li>Select Add Missing Points from Receipt</li>
                    <li>Select Enter Receipt Details</li>
                    <li>Provide the restaurant number from where your order was placed, the date of your visit, the time of your visit, your order number and your order total. All of this information can be found on your receipt.</li>
                    <li>Select Submit</li>
                </ol>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">I Just Made a Purchase and My Points Aren’t There—Can You Help?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Of course, we’d be glad to help you. The first step is wait 24 hours; sometimes it takes a little time for MyMcDonald's Rewards points to appear in the app. If after 24 hours you still don’t have points, here are the steps for you to contact us in the app:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select More</li>
                    <li>Choose Careers, Contact & Legal</li>
                    <li>Select Contact Us</li>
                    <li>Enter your comments regarding your order, including your account email, order number, subtotal, and if there’s any reason you think you might be missing points (example: forgot to scan)</li>
                </ol>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">Do I have to Provide Two Codes If I Want to Redeem a Reward or Deal and Earn Points in the Same Transaction?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">No, you only need to provide one code. When redeeming, provide the 4-digit reward code (found on the Rewards tab)—this will help you redeem your free item while also earning points for products you are purchasing. The same is true for a deal, use the 4-digit deal code to save and you will automatically earn points for products you purchase in that transaction.</p>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">Are There Any Purchases That Don’t Qualify For Points?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Qualifying purchases where an active reward, mobile offer or promotional offer is redeemed will earn points, but you will only earn points for U.S. dollars actually spent in the transaction. When a McDonald’s Arch card is used to make a qualifying purchase, you will earn points. The following are not considered qualifying purchases and will not earn any points:</p>   
            <ol>
                <li>taxes, bags and bottle fees, other surcharges or fees</li>
                <li>loading any money on a McDonald’s Arch Card® (gift card)</li>
                <li>Select Contact Us</li>
                <li>delivery fees for orders placed using the McDonald’s app</li>
            </ol>   
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">
            <p class="word-1a">How do I link my card for payment in the app?</p>
            <p class="word-1b">Linking you card for more convenient payment in the app is easy: Simply,</p>   
            <ol>
                <li>Go to ‘Earn Points’ in the McDonald’s app</li>
                <li>Select “Pay with Linked Card” at the top</li>
                <li>Insert your card information and hit save</li>

            </ol>    
        </div>
        <div class="word-1">

            <p class="word-1b">We’re sorry about your phone! Contact your service provider and once you have a new phone your MyMcDonald’s Rewards should still be waiting for you when you log in to <span><a href="n">our app</a></span></p>
